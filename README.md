## Hi there 👋

Hi, 
I’m a Java Backend Developer

Java backend developer with hands-on experience in building scalable backend systems, RESTful APIs, and microservices architectures. I have worked on end-to-end full-stack applications, from database design to frontend integration, with practical exposure to containerization, cloud deployment, and CI/CD pipelines.

I focus on writing clean, maintainable code, understanding system design, and applying real-world backend engineering practices.
